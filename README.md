# earth_system_sciencehub_challenge

Welcome to Earth System Science Hub Challenge 2024!

This repository hosts a template, you could use for submission of your Jupyter Notebook, which you will produce during the challenge. It includes some suggestions regarding the structure of the notebook and important information to be provided in your final notebook.

There's also a template of PowerPoint presentation (.pptx) which contains the guidelines on how to convert your code into meaningful story to take part in the competition for publishing your results on EODashboard! 

Please use the jupyter notebook and the presentation templates in the directory `/templates`.
